## Purpose

The purpose of the Pokemon Battle Game is to provide users with a fun and simple way to play a game that mimics the classic rock-paper-scissors game. In this game, players can choose to play as one of three Pokemon types: fire, grass, or water. The game determines the winner and deals damage based on the relationship between the two Pokemon types: fire beats grass, grass beats water, and water beats fire.

## Motivation

The Pokemon Battle Game was created as a fun and simple way to bring a classic game to a new audience. The game is designed to be easy to play and enjoyable for all ages. 

## Tech Stack

The Pokemon Battle Game was built using the following technologies:

-   HTML: A markup language for creating web pages
-   CSS: A stylesheet language for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML
-   JavaScript: A programming language for creating interactive web applications

## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building this game is the challenge of creating a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensuring that the game works properly on different devices and browsers can be a challenge.

##  Accomplishments

One accomplishment that I achieved with this game is the creation of a fun and simple way to play a classic game on the web. The game is designed to be easy to play and enjoyable for all ages.

I was also able to use media queries to make the webpage responsive, ensuring that it adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes on both desktop computers and mobile devices. This allows users to view the webpage properly regardless of the device they are using, improving the overall accessibility and user experience of the site. 

## Future Improvements

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Pokemon Battle Game in the future. Some potential improvements include:

-   Adding support for additional Pokemon types and abilities
-   Implementing additional visual and audio effects to enhance the overall gaming experience.
